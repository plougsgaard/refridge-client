# ReFridge Client
Something to do with a fridge. Few (if any) people know what this is, and fewer yet know what it will become.

## Setup

Some ramblings about the current setup.

### Standard

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)

Get an editor plugin that supports this; or install the CLI by going `npm install -g standard`.

### React 0.14-RC1

The bloodiest edge. Will be interesting to see how well it plays with the other children.

### Webpack

For the ease of use with *hot* reloading.

## Installation

`npm install`

`npm install -g webpack webpack-dev-server`

## Developing

`webpack-dev-server`

`open http://localhost:8080`
